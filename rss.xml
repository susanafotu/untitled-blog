hosted at my alma mater, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mills.edu&quot;&gt;Mills College&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.kaporcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/techintersections.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;tech intersections banner&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As described on the website: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech Intersections is an affordable conference for the womxn* of color most underrepresented in tech
to come together and learn from each other’s successes, challenges, and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only was this conference a chance to visit Mills — my second home — but it afforded me the opportunity
to engage in a community within tech that I often feel starved of in Minnesota. This is not to say that my
current place of work isn’t inclusive or supportive, but that it’s vastly male. On my current team,
I believe I was the &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; woman to join. And I joined a mere six months after the first woman joined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew going into the conference that I was going to be in &lt;em&gt;my community&lt;/em&gt;, but I didn’t realize the emotional
impact that would have one me. As I entered campus gates, I immediately felt nostalgic. As I registered for the
conference and saw a handful of powerful womxn I went to Mills with, I was overcome with feelings of empowerment
and inspiration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It only got better as the day progressed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the opening keynote, breakfast was served and to grand amusement there was a &lt;strong&gt;mimosa bar&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media0.giphy.com/media/l4FGrc36ps3naFSow/giphy.gif&quot; alt=&quot;gif from Girls Trip movie where they are cheersing mimosas&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the opening session, we heard from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cybercodetwins.com/&quot;&gt;Cyber Code Twins&lt;/a&gt; and their journey from
the East L.A. projects to international hackathon fame. Their sheer, intoxicating joy and excitement is enough to
make anyone want to go out there and try to make a difference whether that be at hackathons or elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Cyber Code Twins, the opening session also featured a music x tech piece by
&lt;a href=&quot;http://techintersections.org/speakers/briana-marela/&quot;&gt;Briana Marela&lt;/a&gt; (a Mills College electronic art student). Perhaps my favorite part of the entire
performance was when Briana created sounds by flicking water into a bowl. The bowl, I believe, was equipped with
some kind of sensors which translated the density of the drops of water into different tones and intensities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the day, I had the immense pleasure to:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👩🏻‍💻 hear about the 1st generation in a tech career experience featuring some of my Mills friends&lt;br&gt;
👩🏻‍💻 listen to some of my favorite online tech influencers (notably &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vogueandcode&quot;&gt;April Speight&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
👩🏻‍💻 meet and make connections with a great handful of womxn of color in tech  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even now, I’m having a hard time properly articulating what this conference meant to me.&lt;/em&gt; I am immensely grateful for
the opportunity I was given to attend, and so glad that there is a dedicated space to create community and ulimately
remind us all that we’re not alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Catch me at Tech Intersections 2020 and every following year!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; 👩🏻‍💻💪🏼🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*womxn&lt;/strong&gt;: an intersectional reclaimation of the word “woman” meant to be inclusive of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; individuals who
identify as womxn.

&lt;p&gt;But like the ♓️I am, I let myself get lazy and end up with lots of unfinished
projects: &lt;em&gt;I’m looking directly at an unfinished canvas as I type this.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media1.tenor.com/images/b8cfc069b7f6b3c7b6479935d5bfa744/tenor.gif?itemid=4519756&quot; alt=&quot;lazy seal gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the off chance that I have a spurt of inspiration and drive to complete
something for myself, I tend to become obsessive over the tiniest of details
and &lt;strong&gt;spend hours&lt;/strong&gt; trying to get something &lt;em&gt;just right&lt;/em&gt;. Whoever said &lt;em&gt;you are your own worst enemy&lt;/em&gt;
couldn’t have of been more right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the creation of this blog, for example, I spent a couple &lt;strong&gt;hours&lt;/strong&gt; alone trying to decide on a color palette —
looking for colors I liked that were also widely accessible. To accomplish this, I used a combination of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://colorsafe.co/&quot;&gt;Color Safe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mycolor.space/&quot;&gt;Color Space&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://paletton.com/&quot;&gt;Paletton&lt;/a&gt;,
and &lt;a href=&quot;https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/&quot;&gt;Web Aim Color Contrast Checker&lt;/a&gt;. After spending a couple
hours on a color palette alone, I was quickly burnt out on all work for this blog so I published and called it
quits for the night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning, I checked the blog to realize I hadn’t changed the favicon (something I was most excited about creating)
to something of my own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://pm1.narvii.com/6294/52f5bc75583630946a5b06ef1df63b34f68e2950_128.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Homer Simpson &amp;#x22;doh&amp;#x22;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to kill 2 birds with 1 stone, I decided that I would practice time-boxing myself and my advance Sketch skills
by creating a favicon for myself. I knew that I wanted the icon to be a 🍍 — pineapples have been a symbolic part
of my life for some years now — but I was unsure of how I wanted the icon to look and feel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Getting down to business to create a favicon&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First time-box&lt;/strong&gt;: drawing a pineapple icon I liked.
To accomplish this task, I gave myself 10 minutes to roughly sketch something out. Within the time constraints, I was
able to create a pencil version of a pineapple I actually liked quite a bit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I somewhat cheated after my allotted time, and used up another 5min to color the drawing in so I would have more
reference when transforming the drawing into an icon. This is the finalized drawing: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KtClT8X.png&quot; alt=&quot;my first pineapple drawing&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a drawing I was happy with, I was ready to open up Sketch and getting to vectorizing! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second time-box&lt;/strong&gt;: excercising my Sketch skills.
To create my icon, I chose Sketch because it’s a standard tool that UX designers at Target use and because
I know it to be new user-friendly. In college, though I created a handful of websites from the ground up, the
teams I was on were never concerned with — or given an opportunity to —fully explore design and user experience,
so I never had much opportunity to learn design toolings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went through a &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/sketch-app-sources/how-to-use-sketch-to-build-great-icons-9c3d982ae91d&quot;&gt;Sketch icon tutorial by Christian Krammeron&lt;/a&gt;
to get a better idea of the tools I could use and where to even start. Knowing that I would be learning Sketch
as I attempted to vectorize my drawing, I gave myself a time-box of 1 hour and still fumbled around a lot of that hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This the icon I created at the end of that hour: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/njeS3bft.png?1&quot; alt=&quot;my first draft of the pineapple icon made using Sketch&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From that exercise I experienced a lot of pain points in how I was using Sketch: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🎨 For the crown, I used the vector tool to draw individual points that I connected with rounded edges rather than
using a shape tool to get uniformity off the bat&lt;br&gt;
🎨 I created all the lines on the body and then one-by-one curved them&lt;br&gt;
🎨 The fill tool wasn’t giving me the right blend and overall feel I was hoping for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third time’s a charm?&lt;/strong&gt;
I was not very pleased with my first pineapple iteration, and particularly not happy with how Sketch plays with color blends.
I pivoted my pineapple design to be more minimalist and cohesive with the color palette I chose for this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of using the vector tool to draw out the crown, I chose to use the star tool to create the size I wanted and then
rounded out the stars edges and curved the connecting lines. For the minimalist look, I stripped out all fill colors and
changed the color of the pineapple line to be #1ca086 &lt;img src=&quot;https://placehold.it/15/1ca086/000000?text=+&quot; alt=&quot;#1ca086&quot;&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current icon: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xsSkIMkt.png&quot; alt=&quot;minimalized pineapple icon&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s in no way perfect, but I’m happy with where the icon ended up and much more comfortable with using Sketch to create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do plan on further iterating on the icon, but now feel much more confident in my ability to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✅ time-box myself&lt;br&gt;
✅ use Sketch and learn how to best optimize my skills&lt;br&gt;
✅ express my own creativity&lt;/p&gt;

I &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; made progress on a side project!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tenor.com/images/424b004561d02b05588d5ce8e3ab4136/tenor.gif&quot; alt=&quot;excited dance gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started this blog — entitled “untitled blog” until I
can think of a name I like — not only as a way to
communicate and hold myself accountable for what
I am learning, mulling over, and experiencing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What I hope to accomplish here&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☀️ Document my own learning, thoughts, and experiences&lt;br&gt;
☀️ Learn more about GatsbyJS &amp;#x26; specifically GraphQL&lt;br&gt;
☀️ Achieve one of my 2019 goals  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How I hope to accomplish the above&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☁️ Write and publish pieces once every week&lt;br&gt;
☁️ Alternate the topic / method of each written pieces&lt;br&gt;
☁️ Maintain self-accountability &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major ups to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.org&quot;&gt;GatsbyJS&lt;/a&gt; and
their amazing docs that allowed me to get up and running
almost immediately. A post in the very near future will
be about my experience working with Gatsby and my
thoughts, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without further adieu, I leave you with an adorable
pupper gif while I continue working on this blog!&lt;/p&gt;
