Last weekend, I had the immense pleasure to attend [Tech Intersections](http://techintersections.org)
hosted at my alma mater, [Mills College](https://mills.edu).

As described on the website: 
> Tech Intersections is an affordable conference for the womxn* of color most underrepresented in tech 
> to come together and learn from each other’s successes, challenges, and experiences.

Not only was this conference a chance to visit Mills -- my second home -- but it afforded me the opportunity
to engage in a community within tech that I often feel starved of in Minnesota. This is not to say that my
current place of work isn't inclusive or supportive, but that it's vastly male. On my current team,
I believe I was the _second_ woman to join. And I joined a mere six months after the first woman joined.

I knew going into the conference that I was going to be in _my community_, but I didn't realize the emotional
impact that would have one me. As I entered campus gates, I immediately felt nostalgic. As I registered for the
conference and saw a handful of powerful womxn I went to Mills with, I was overcome with feelings of empowerment
and inspiration. 

It only got better as the day progressed. 

Before the opening keynote, breakfast was served and to grand amusement there was a **mimosa bar**.

In the opening session, we heard from the [Cyber Code Twins](https://www.cybercodetwins.com/) and their journey from
the East L.A. projects to international hackathon fame. Their sheer, intoxicating joy and excitement is enough to 
make anyone want to go out there and try to make a difference whether that be at hackathons or elsewhere. 

In addition to the Cyber Code Twins, the opening session also featured a music x tech piece by
[Briana Marela](http://techintersections.org/speakers/briana-marela/) (a Mills College electronic art student). Perhaps my favorite part of the entire
performance was when Briana created sounds by flicking water into a bowl. The bowl, I believe, was equipped with
some kind of sensors which translated the density of the drops of water into different tones and intensities.

Throughout the day, I had the immense pleasure to:  

👩🏻‍💻 hear about the 1st generation in a tech career experience featuring some of my Mills friends  
👩🏻‍💻 listen to some of my favorite online tech influencers (notably [April Speight](https://twitter.com/vogueandcode))  
👩🏻‍💻 meet and make connections with a great handful of womxn of color in tech  

_Even now, I'm having a hard time properly articulating what this conference meant to me._ I am immensely grateful for 
the opportunity I was given to attend, and so glad that there is a dedicated space to create community and ulimately 
remind us all that we're not alone. 

**_Catch me at Tech Intersections 2020 and every following year!_** 👩🏻‍💻💪🏼🎉
