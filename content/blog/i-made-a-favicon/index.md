#### When it comes to being creative, I've _always_ had high hopes and aspirations.  

But like the ‚ôìÔ∏èI am, I let myself get lazy and end up with lots of unfinished
projects: _I'm looking directly at an unfinished canvas as I type this._

And in the off chance that I have a spurt of inspiration and drive to complete
something for myself, I tend to become obsessive over the tiniest of details
and **spend hours** trying to get something _just right_. Whoever said _you are your own worst enemy_
couldn't have of been more right. 

With the creation of this blog, for example, I spent a couple **hours** alone trying to decide on a color palette -- 
looking for colors I liked that were also widely accessible. To accomplish this, I used a combination of
[Color Safe](http://colorsafe.co/), [Color Space](https://mycolor.space/), [Paletton](http://paletton.com/), 
and [Web Aim Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/). After spending a couple 
hours on a color palette alone, I was quickly burnt out on all work for this blog so I published and called it
quits for the night. 

In the morning, I checked the blog to realize I hadn't changed the favicon (something I was most excited about creating)
to something of my own.

So to kill 2 birds with 1 stone, I decided that I would practice time-boxing myself and my advance Sketch skills 
by creating a favicon for myself. I knew that I wanted the icon to be a üçç -- pineapples have been a symbolic part
of my life for some years now -- but I was unsure of how I wanted the icon to look and feel. 

#### Getting down to business to create a favicon

**First time-box**: drawing a pineapple icon I liked.
To accomplish this task, I gave myself 10 minutes to roughly sketch something out. Within the time constraints, I was
able to create a pencil version of a pineapple I actually liked quite a bit. 

I somewhat cheated after my allotted time, and used up another 5min to color the drawing in so I would have more
reference when transforming the drawing into an icon. This is the finalized drawing:

With a drawing I was happy with, I was ready to open up Sketch and getting to vectorizing! 

**Second time-box**: excercising my Sketch skills.
To create my icon, I chose Sketch because it's a standard tool that UX designers at Target use and because
I know it to be new user-friendly. In college, though I created a handful of websites from the ground up, the
teams I was on were never concerned with -- or given an opportunity to --fully explore design and user experience,
so I never had much opportunity to learn design toolings. 

I went through a [Sketch icon tutorial by Christian Krammeron](https://medium.com/sketch-app-sources/how-to-use-sketch-to-build-great-icons-9c3d982ae91d)
to get a better idea of the tools I could use and where to even start. Knowing that I would be learning Sketch
as I attempted to vectorize my drawing, I gave myself a time-box of 1 hour and still fumbled around a lot of that hour.

This the icon I created at the end of that hour:

From that exercise I experienced a lot of pain points in how I was using Sketch: 

üé® For the crown, I used the vector tool to draw individual points that I connected with rounded edges rather than
using a shape tool to get uniformity off the bat  
üé® I created all the lines on the body and then one-by-one curved them  
üé® The fill tool wasn't giving me the right blend and overall feel I was hoping for

**Third time's a charm?**
I was not very pleased with my first pineapple iteration, and particularly not happy with how Sketch plays with color blends.
I pivoted my pineapple design to be more minimalist and cohesive with the color palette I chose for this blog.

Instead of using the vector tool to draw out the crown, I chose to use the star tool to create the size I wanted and then
rounded out the stars edges and curved the connecting lines. For the minimalist look, I stripped out all fill colors and 
changed the color of the pineapple line to be #1ca086 ![#1ca086](https://placehold.it/15/1ca086/000000?text=+). 

My current icon:

It's in no way perfect, but I'm happy with where the icon ended up and much more comfortable with using Sketch to create.

I do plan on further iterating on the icon, but now feel much more confident in my ability to:

‚úÖ time-box myself  
‚úÖ use Sketch and learn how to best optimize my skills   
‚úÖ express my own creativity
