#### Look! I *actually* made progress on a side project!

I started this blog — entitled "untitled blog" until I 
can think of a name I like — not only as a way to 
communicate and hold myself accountable for what
I am learning, mulling over, and experiencing. 

#### What I hope to accomplish here

☀️ Document my own learning, thoughts, and experiences   
☀️ Learn more about GatsbyJS & specifically GraphQL  
☀️ Achieve one of my 2019 goals  

#### How I hope to accomplish the above

☁️ Write and publish pieces once every week  
☁️ Alternate the topic / method of each written pieces  
☁️ Maintain self-accountability 

Major ups to [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) and
their amazing docs that allowed me to get up and running
almost immediately. A post in the very near future will
be about my experience working with Gatsby and my
thoughts, etc. 

Without furtheradieu, I leave you with an adorable
pupper gif while I continue working on this blog!
